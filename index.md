# DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING Portfolio


## Heart Disease Prediction


Machine learning can be used to detect whether a person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease by considering certain attributes like chest pain, cholesterol level, age of the person and some other attributes.

## Logistic Regression for Telecom churn


In telecommunication the customers churning very frequently. As the market in telecom is fiercely competitive, in that case, companies proactively have to determine the customers churn by analyzing their behavior and try to put effort and money in retaining the customers. In this proposed model, two machine-learning techniques were used for predicting customer churn Logistic regression and Logit Boost.

## Housing Case Study
Multiple regression is a statistical technique that can be used to analyze the relationship between a single dependent variable and several independent variables. 
These includes; dependent variable(y)-house price and Independent variable (xâ€™s) - house type, number of rooms, internal size and distance.

## K-Mode Clustering on Bank Marketing Dataset
K-Mode clustering is a clustering algorithm used for categorical data, which is suitable for analyzing datasets with discrete attributes. In this case, K-Mode clustering can be applied to the Bank Marketing Dataset to identify groups of customers with similar attributes.
This information can then be used to design more targeted and effective marketing strategies, ultimately leading to higher conversion rates and revenue for the bank.
